This is version *six* of my website! How about that?!
And at a new domain, *`eli.td`*.

I purchased this domain from the French, because it is a domain of Chad (Tchad, as they say, hence the "td").
But I do have the DNS through Namecheap and that's working out well for me.
For instance, they make it easy to point subdomains to URLs, so [zoom.eli.td](http://zoom.eli.td) should be my
personal Zoom meeting. (No guarantees I'm there currently :slightly_smiling_face:).

Of course, there's not an immediate reason why I *needed* a new site to go with the new domain,
but v5 never really matured and I wasn't that happy with it anyway.
v6 looks pretty similar, I'll admit, in places, but it's built pretty much completely from scratch
(using new tools: see following post).
