**tl;dr Vue 3, Vite, rolled my own CSS**


Versions 1-4 of this site were at `dte.li`.

While I was using an interim domain, `etd.is` for version 5, I had built a version of this site out
using Vue 2 and Vue CLI.
Now that Vite is a thing I've switched to that.

Getting Markdown and SVG support working involved using some plugins that folks has already written,
namely
- [`vite-plugin-markdown`](https://github.com/hmsk/vite-plugin-markdown) and
- [`vite-svg-loader`](https://github.com/jpkleemans/vite-svg-loader).

I was thinking of using Tailwind for this but for my own site I like to keep the CSS homegrown.
