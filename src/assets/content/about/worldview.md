## Religious

I'm an atheist.
I wouldn't call myself militant, but I do hold that position pretty strongly.
I don't think there's a personal being or force out there.
I mean sure, we could be (and maybe probably are) living in a simulation put on by either aliens or beings similar to ourselves studying their own history or whatever, but that's not the same as there being a personal god who's not subject to some set of rules.
I guess I'm not "spiritual" either, for the same reason.




## Economic

I'm some form of a leftist. I think that the complaint often applied to communism---"it works in theory but not in practice"---applies even more so to capitalism. Capitalism, particularly when it's anything but strictly regulated, is really nifty idea that should stay in economics departments; when played out, it is deeply inhumane and not grounded in fundamental realities. Of course, that by itself doesn't mean leftist systems are inherently humane or work better, but I tend to think there's a happy medium that tilts towards the left.

I'm not going to weigh in on how we get there at the moment.




## Values

### What do I value?

- Love for individuals
- Passion
- Truth
- Knowledge, understanding

### What else do I value?

- Technological progress
- Romantic partnership
- Novelty


### What do I not value?

- Patriotism
- Work in and of itself





### What are some things I believe?

- It is our moral obligation to extend life indefinitely (and we are failing miserably at this).
- Corporations are not people.
- Drugs are good (hallucinogens and stimulants especially), although they can be misused.
- True beauty comes from innovation, which is mostly the domain of humanity (so far).
- Dogs are pure, but they aren't deep. Purity is a nice thing to have around though.
- The idea of fault/blame is a convenient abstraction for something that doesn't really exist.
- We are very probably alone in the cosmos.
- Some form of panpsychism is probably accurate.
- Religion is bad, actually.
- Universally open borders is a humanitarian cause.


### What are some views I could be cancelled for?

- ha
- yeah right
