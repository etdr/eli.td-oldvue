  <h1>quasi-academician</h1>
  <h3>“quasi” basically meaning “former” or “once-prospective”</h3>

  <p>
    From 2013 to 2016 I was in the Netherlands working on my Master's degree in logic at the University of Amsterdam.
    I of course learned a lot, both about logic and about myself.
  </p>
  <p>
    The culmination of this effort was the writing of <em>Readtable-Macro Transducer-Chain Parsing</em>,
    my thesis written under the supervision of Dr. Bruno Loff.

    I want to write more about it soon, but for now you can download it <a href="https://eli.td/rmtc" target="_blank">here</a>.
